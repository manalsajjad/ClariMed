AI-Assisted Prescription Clarity Empowering Patients with voice and text assistance for Better Health Through AI-Driven Clarity

## Description
Medication non-adherence is a critical issue that leads to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Many patients face challenges in understanding their prescriptions, including the purpose of medicines and tests prescribed by doctors, particularly in regions where language barriers exist. Additionally, patients with disabilities—such as those who cannot read or see—struggle to access and comprehend this vital information. This gap between healthcare providers and patients diminishes the effectiveness of treatment, leading to non-compliance and worsening health conditions.

Our project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging "gpt-4o-mini" model from Azure OpenAI to provide clear, accessible, and inclusive information. This AI-powered healthcare solution will help patients, including those with visual or reading impairments, understand their prescriptions through audio-based guidance in their native language. By supporting both Hindi and English, our tool ensures broader accessibility, starting in India, with plans to expand globally in future iterations. The solution empowers all patients, regardless of language or ability, to better understand their medications and prescribed tests, promoting improved adherence, better health outcomes, and a more efficient healthcare system.

We further plan to leverage Content filters from Azure OpenAI to block conveying information which might be Harmful or related to Hate/Violence.
